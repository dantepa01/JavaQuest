I started JavaQuest in 2020 when I was a senior in high school. I was so excited about learning to code that I stayed up all night for about a week coding this project with my very elementary knowledge of Java. 
Over the years, as I learned more and grew as a student, I refined a lot of the worst parts of the program. It is still very rough as I haven't touched it in over a year, but I am still very proud of it. 
JavaQuest is a text-style, turn-based RPG based off of Dragon Quest's combat. I am a big fan of JRPGs, and I wanted to create something that I could see myself enjoying if I played it on my phone.
